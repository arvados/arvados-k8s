  ### Google+ OAuth2 authentication.
  ###
  # Google API tokens required for OAuth2 login.

  #
  # and https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2
  google_oauth2_client_id: false
  google_oauth2_client_secret: false

  # Set this to your OpenId 2.0 realm to enable migration from Google OpenId
  # 2.0 to Google OAuth2 OpenId Connect (Google will provide OpenId 2.0 user
  # identifiers via the openid.realm parameter in the OAuth2 flow until 2017).

  ###
  ### LDAP authentication.
  ###
  #
  # If you want to use LDAP, you need to provide
  # the following set of fields under the use_ldap key.
  #
  # If 'email_domain' field is set, it will be stripped from the email address
  # entered by the user prior attempting LDAP binding on 'uid'.  This supports
  # the case where it is not possible to look up 'bob@example.com' but instead
  # must be looked up as 'uid=bob'.
  #
  # If it is possible to look up the email address directly (for example
  # setting "uid: mail") you should prefer that and leave 'email_domain' unset.
  #
  # If 'username' is set, this specifies the LDAP field that will be propagated
  # to the "username" field in the users table.  This should be a
  # posix-compatible username (which may be different from the username part of
  # the email address.)
  #
  # Provide 'bind_dn' and 'password' if your LDAP server requires
  # a login before authenticating a user.
  #
  # use_ldap:
  #   title: Example LDAP
  #   host: ldap.example.com
  #   port: 636
  #   method: ssl
